# Steam Data Analysis
## Overview
Video games are a huge industry nowadays, with millions of people playing games every day. The main platform for distributing games made for PC is Steam, for which there is a lot of data freely available. The goal of this project is to research Steam data for insights on the behaviour of its users and how it differs for various games.

Without much surprise, the analysis is going to pay special attention to the games I personally have an interest in. That encompasses mostly strategies as they are my long-time favourite genre, and particularly the games created by the Paradox Development Studio - my favourite game creator.

## Kaggle data analysis
Before going through the effort of gathering the data ourselves let us first explore the existing Steam datasets from Kaggle. While they might not always match the questions perfectly, there are still some insights to be extracted.

The data is not going to be stored on GitHub since some of the files can be rather large in size. Instead, each file will have an ID in the name indicating its source.
